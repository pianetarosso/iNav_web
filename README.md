This is the front-end for my thesis project.

This Django app manage and offers to the user the methods to create a map of a building.

This project is still in alpha.

In this version you can find:

 - Wizard to create a building:
        
        + bearing management for each floor;
        + geolocalization of the building; 
        + creation af paths and RFID markers for every floor
        

 - Connection with a custom Android client:
 
        + search of the building based on position and distance;
        + download of buildings
        + automatic update based on building version
